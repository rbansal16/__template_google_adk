# Google ADK Multi-Agent Service

This repository is built based on Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) tutorial. It implements a multi-agent service with centralized logging and MCP client integration for tool interactions. Developed by [BansalAI](https://www.bansalai.com) - Your partner for enterprise AI solutions.

## Features

### Implemented
âœ… **Tool Definition & Usage**: Crafting Python functions (tools) that grant agents specific abilities (like fetching data) and instructing agents on how to use them effectively.

âœ… **Multi-LLM Flexibility**: Configuring agents to utilize various leading LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) via LiteLLM integration, allowing you to choose the best model for each task.

âœ… **Agent Delegation & Collaboration**: Designing specialized sub-agents and enabling automatic routing (auto flow) of user requests to the most appropriate agent within a team.

âœ… **Session State for Memory**: Utilizing Session State and ToolContext to enable agents to remember information across conversational turns, leading to more contextual interactions.

âœ… **Centralized Logging**: Implemented a comprehensive logging system that can be configured through environment variables for consistent logging across all components.

### Planned
ðŸ”² **Safety Guardrails with Callbacks**: Implementing before_model_callback and before_tool_callback to inspect, modify, or block requests/tool usage based on predefined rules, enhancing application safety and control.

## Centralized Logging

This project uses a centralized logging system that can be configured through environment variables.

### Configuration

In your `.env` file, you can set:

```
# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_PATH=logs   # Directory to store log files
```

### Usage

In any module where you need logging:

```python
from shared_libraries import get_logger

# Initialize logger with the current module name
logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Use standard logging methods
logger.info("Information message")
logger.warning("Warning message")
logger.error("Error message")
```

## Tools

The project includes several example tools:

1. `get_weather.py` - Retrieves weather information for a specified city
2. `get_current_time.py` - Gets the current time for a specified city
3. `say_hello.py` - Generates greeting messages
4. `say_goodbye.py` - Generates farewell messages

All tools follow a consistent pattern and error handling structure.

## Multi-Agent System

The repository implements a multi-agent system where:

1. **Root Agent**: Coordinates all requests and delegates to specialized sub-agents
2. **Greeting Agent**: Handles user greetings
3. **Farewell Agent**: Handles user farewells
4. **Weather Agent**: Provides weather information for specific cities
